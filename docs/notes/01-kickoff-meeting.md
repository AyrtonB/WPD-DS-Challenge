# Kickoff Meeting - 28th January 2021

We get three datasets: demand at a single substation; solar PV data from a site near the substation; weather reanalysis. Each task is 1 week long, where we are given the weather reanalysis data and no demand or solar. The is to produce a battery schedule that maximises a score function that promotes peak demand reduction (between 3.30â€“9pm each day) and the proportion of the batteries charge that came from solar PV (vs. the grid)

First challenge is a practice that is due in 2 weeks i think, then there is one every week after that for 4 weeks
